# My Website
This is my personal website. This site showcases my projects, skills, and experiences as a software engineer. I am also going to be adding a blog that will *hopefully* receive regular updates. 

It can be visited at [emorque.com](https://emorque.github.io/Portfolio/)

I also made sure to adjust values for smaller screens, so visting on mobile devices is welcome!

I'm super flattered if you would like you run my website locally.
Since it is build with solely HTML, CSS, and JS, all that is required is to download all files from here and run:
``` bash
index.html
